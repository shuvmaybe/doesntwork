            <p class="sub">Save your time and everyone else's by being clear and specific.</p>

            <p>It's incredibly frustrating to see messages like "I followed all the steps, but it <em>doesn't work</em>" without any further details. How are we supposed to help you with that?</p>
            <p>When you encounter an issue, provide the necessary details right away. Here's what you should include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>What is not happening:</strong> Clearly state what isn't happening as expected. For example: "<em>I installed this theme, but the background is white instead of black.</em>"</li>
                <li><strong>What should happen:</strong> Describe the expected outcome. For instance: "<em>The theme should display a black background.</em>"</li>
                <li><strong>Provide error messages & additional information:</strong> Include any error messages and relevant context. For example: "<em>No error messages, but the background color is incorrect.</em>"</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Here's an example of how using "Doesn't work" wastes time:</p>

            <p>It took Joe <em>8 minutes</em> to get his problem fixed, just because he started with "doesn't work" instead of explaining the problem right away.</p>
            <p>What Joe should have done was explain the issue he was encountering and what he expected to happen. In this case, his theme was supposed to have a black background, but it was white.</p>

            <p>Joe's issue was now fixed in <font color="#96F316"><em>3 minutes</em></font>! 62.5% Faster than with just saying 'doesn't work' every couple of messages.</p>


            <p class="sub"><strong>When 'Doesn't work' is acceptable:</strong></p>
            <p>While the importance of explaining your issue right away is emphasized and resolved, there are times when using "doesn't work" is appropriate:</p>
            <p>For example, when seeking solutions known to have similar error messages or identical situations, such as:</p>

            <p>Here, Obama used "Doesn't work" effectively to quickly resolve his issue, as Donald was already aware of the context from earlier messages.</p>
