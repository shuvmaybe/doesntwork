            <p class="sub">Instead save yours, and everybody else's time.</p>

            <p>Grown tired of coming to a chatroom just to see a person saying they followed all the steps for something and suddenly <em>it doesn't work</em> without any additional information.</p>
            <p>Man, what do I do with this information? How do you expect us to help you without knowing what the problem is?</p>
            <p>What you should learn is whenever you have an issue and need help, make sure to format your message with this information:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>What is not happening:</strong> Clearly state what is not happening as expected. For example: "I was trying to get this value."</li>
                <li><strong>What should happen:</strong> Describe the expected outcome. For instance: "It should get the value."</li>
                <li><strong>Provide error messages & additional information:</strong> Include any error messages encountered and relevant context. For instance: "<x>Value does not exist.</x>"</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Here is how time wasteful using "Doesn't work" is:</p>

            <p>It took Joe <em>8 minutes</em> to get his problem fixed, just because he went straight to 'doesn't work' instead of explaining the problem.</p>
            <p>What Joe should of have done instead of immediately whining is to explain the issue he is encountering and what he expected to happen; in this case his theme was supposed to have a black background, instead it was white.</p>

            <p>Joe's issue was now fixed in <font color="#96F316"><em>3 minutes</em></font>! 26% Faster than with just saying 'doesn't work' every couple of messages.</p>


            <p class="sub"><strong>When 'Doesn't work' is acceptable:</strong></p>
            <p>While the importance of explaining your issue right away is emphasized and resolved, there are times when using "doesn't work" is appropriate:</p>
            <p>For example, when seeking solutions known to have similar error messages or identical situations, such as:</p>
            <div class="code">
                <span class="time">[10:30 AM]</span>

                <span class="message"><em>Doesn't work.</em></span>
                <br>

            </div>
            <p>Here Obama, even with using 'Doesn't work' resolved his issue fairly quickly. Since Donald already knew the error he presumed that the error from the first message stayed.</p>
            <p>Obama, even with using the forbidden term, fixed his issues because of correct usage. <em>Be more like Obama.</em></p>
